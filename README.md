# default-environment
My default dev environment

### To run this

```
sudo ansible-pull -U https://github.com/pamsilva/default-environment --extra-vars "user=$USER"
```

### Notes

There is usually this very annoying issue with the cloning the repo, where it complains about permissions. I am not sure if I ever managed to fix it, but when I do, I really need to set it up here.
